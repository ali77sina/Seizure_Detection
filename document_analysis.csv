Sleep stage classification from heart-rate variability using long short ...,"Title of the Paper: Sleep stage classification from heart rate variability using long short term memory neural networks","Sleep stage classification from heart rate variability using long short term memory neural networks aims to provide an ergonomic and low-cost alternative to gold standard polysomnography for unobtrusive home-based sleep monitoring. Current methods are limited in considering long-term sleep patterns. The proposed LSTM network models long-term cardiac sleep architecture, validated on a dataset of 292 participants, achieving a Cohen's k of 0.61 and 77% accuracy across 584 nights. Performance may decline in individuals aged 50+. Results advance HRV-based sleep stage classification."
Automating sleep stage classification using wireless, wearable ...,"Title: Automating sleep stage classification using wireless wearable sensors","The paper presents a novel approach to sleep stage classification using a multimodal sensor system that incorporates hand acceleration, electrocardiography (ECG), and skin temperature. This method aims to provide a portable, unobtrusive alternative to traditional polysomnography (PSG), which is often expensive and uncomfortable for patients. The sensor system outperforms existing wrist monitors, such as ActiWatch, achieving a recall of 74.4% for wake detection and up to 90.0% for sleep detection, as well as differentiating between non-REM and REM sleep stages with varying degrees of accuracy. The findings suggest that this automated system can facilitate better, long-term assessment of sleep patterns, improve diagnosis of sleep disorders, and help monitor health risks in various settings, thereby contributing to enhanced clinical and research capabilities in sleep medicine."
Automatic neonatal sleep stage classification: A comparative study ...,"Automatic neonatal sleep stage classification: A comparative study","Sleep is a fundamental aspect of life, crucial for the mental and physical development of neonates. Accurate classification of sleep stages is vital for assessing neonatal brain and physical health, particularly in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). While polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for monitoring sleep patterns, it is costly and labor-intensive. This review provides an overview of automatic neonatal sleep stage classification algorithms developed over the last two decades, highlighting their limitations and proposing future directions. It details the comparison of various extracted features, classification algorithms, and evaluation methods, emphasizing the need for more efficient and less intrusive monitoring techniques in neonatal healthcare."

When scoring sleep epochs, experts pay attention to find specific signal characteristics, e.g., K complexes and spindles, and sometimes need to integrate information from preceding and subsequent epochs to make a decision. To imitate this process and to build a more interpretable deep learning model, we propose a neural network based on a convolutional network (CNN) and attention mechanism to perform automatic sleep staging. The CNN learns local signal characteristics and the attention mechanism excels in learning inter and intra epoch features. In experiments on the public sleep EDF and sleep EDFX databases with different training and testing set partitioning methods, our model achieved overall accuracies of 93.7% and 82.8% and macro average F1 scores of 84.5% and 77.8% respectively, outperforming recently reported machine learning methods."
